# Raptor: Call of the Shadows Reimagining - Game Architecture

## Technology Stack

For our reimagining of Raptor: Call of the Shadows, we will use the following technologies:

### Core Technologies
- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the game
- **CSS3**: For styling and visual effects
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For game logic and interactivity

### Game Development Framework
- **HTML5 Canvas API**: For rendering the game graphics
- **No external game engines**: To keep the game lightweight and ensure it runs well on the Dell laptop

### Audio
- **Web Audio API**: For sound effects and background music

### Development Tools
- **Git**: For version control
- **npm**: For package management (minimal dependencies)
- **ESLint**: For code quality

### Deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the final game (if needed)

## Game Architecture

### 1. Core Game Engine

The game engine will be built using the Entity-Component System (ECS) architecture, which is well-suited for game development:

```
Game Engine
├── Game Loop
│   ├── Update Logic
│   └── Render Logic
├── Input Handler
├── Asset Manager
├── Audio Manager
├── Collision System
└── Entity Manager
```

#### Game Loop
- Fixed time step for consistent gameplay across different devices
- Separate update and render phases
- Frame rate limiting to prevent excessive CPU usage

#### Input Handler
- Keyboard input for movement and actions
- Support for both WASD and arrow keys
- Optional mouse control for menu navigation

#### Asset Manager
- Preload all game assets (images, audio)
- Cache assets for quick access
- Handle loading screens

#### Audio Manager
- Sound effect playback
- Background music with looping capability
- Volume control

#### Collision System
- Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) collision detection
- Collision response for different entity types
- Optimized collision checks using spatial partitioning

#### Entity Manager
- Create, update, and destroy game entities
- Manage entity lifecycles
- Group entities by type for optimized processing

### 2. Game Entities

```
Entities
├── Player
├── Enemies
│   ├── Air Enemies
│   └── Ground Installations
├── Projectiles
│   ├── Player Projectiles
│   └── Enemy Projectiles
├── Collectibles
├── Explosions
└── Environment
```

#### Player Entity
- Player ship with health/shield system
- Weapon system with multiple weapon types
- Movement constraints within game boundaries
- Visual feedback for damage and power-ups

#### Enemy Entities
- Different enemy types with unique behaviors
- Health systems and damage feedback
- Movement patterns based on enemy type
- Spawn patterns based on level design

#### Projectile Entities
- Different projectile types for player and enemies
- Damage values and visual effects
- Collision detection with appropriate entities

#### Collectible Entities
- Weapon power-ups
- Health/shield power-ups
- Money/score items
- Special items (Megabombs, etc.)

#### Explosion Entities
- Visual effects for different explosion types
- Animation system for explosions
- Sound effects tied to explosions

#### Environment Entities
- Scrolling background
- Decorative elements
- Obstacles and terrain

### 3. Game States

```
Game States
├── Boot State
├── Loading State
├── Main Menu State
├── Hangar State
├── Supply Room State
├── Game State
│   ├── Level 1
│   └── Level 2
├── Pause State
└── Game Over State
```

#### State Management
- Clean transitions between states
- Persistent data across relevant states
- Memory management during state changes

### 4. Rendering System

```
Rendering System
├── Background Layer
├── Environment Layer
├── Enemy Layer
├── Player Layer
├── Projectile Layer
├── Explosion Layer
├── UI Layer
└── Overlay Layer
```

#### Layer-Based Rendering
- Multiple canvas layers for performance optimization
- Z-ordering for proper visual hierarchy
- Parallax scrolling for background elements

### 5. Data Management

```
Data Management
├── Level Data
│   ├── Enemy Spawn Patterns
│   ├── Environment Layout
│   └── Boss Configurations
├── Player Data
│   ├── Weapon Inventory
│   ├── Health/Shield Status
│   └── Score/Money
└── Game Progress Data
```

#### Data Storage
- In-memory storage during gameplay
- LocalStorage for saving game progress
- JSON format for data structures

## Level Design

### Level 1 (Wave 1)
- Scrolling water and land terrain
- Basic enemy patterns with increasing difficulty
- Collectibles: Energy Module and Air/Air Missile
- End-level boss with simple attack pattern

### Level 2 (Wave 2)
- More complex terrain with obstacles
- Increased enemy variety and density
- More challenging enemy patterns
- Collectibles: Energy Module and Small Arms
- More challenging end-level boss

## Performance Considerations

- **Asset Optimization**: Sprite sheets for efficient rendering
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of unused objects
- **Rendering Optimization**: Layer-based rendering and object pooling
- **Collision Optimization**: Spatial partitioning for collision detection
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Responsive design for different screen sizes
