- Environment objects appear correctly in JSON output

### ✅ JSON Output
- Real-time JSON generation works perfectly
- JSON is properly formatted with 4-space indentation
- Empty override objects are cleaned up automatically
- JSON structure matches the LEVEL_DATA_FORMAT.md specification exactly

## JSON Output Example
The editor successfully generated the following JSON structure:
```json
{
    "levelName": "New Level",
    "waves": [
        {
            "wave_id": "wave_1",
            "delay_after_previous_wave_ms": 3000,
            "enemies": [
                {
                    "type": "striker",
                    "spawn_x": 300,
                    "spawn_y": -50,
                    "delay": 1000,
                    "overrides": {
                        "movementPattern": "move_to_point_and_hold"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "environment_objects": [
                {
                    "type": "FUEL_TANK",
                    "spawn_x": 150,
                    "spawn_y": 400,
                    "delay": 0
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Conclusion
The Level Editor is fully functional and meets all requirements specified in the original task. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating complex level configurations with dynamic behavior overrides and generates clean, properly formatted JSON output that matches the game's data format specification.
