# Audio Files for Raptor: Call of the Shadows Reimagined

This directory should contain the following audio files for the game:

## Sound Effects

- `player_shoot.mp3` - Sound effect for player's primary weapon
- `enemy_shoot.mp3` - Sound effect for enemy weapons
- `explosion.mp3` - Sound effect for explosions
- `player_damage.mp3` - Sound effect for player taking damage
- `pickup.mp3` - Sound effect for collecting power-ups
- `megabomb.mp3` - Sound effect for megabomb explosion

## Music

- `menu_music.mp3` - Background music for the menu
- `game_music_1.mp3` - Background music for level 1
- `game_music_2.mp3` - Background music for level 2

## Note

For the prototype version, the game will still function without these audio files, but will display console warnings when attempting to play missing audio files. In a production version, these files should be replaced with actual audio assets.
